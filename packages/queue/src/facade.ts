// src/facade.ts
// @streetjs/queue — the strongly-typed Queue facade (Req 1.5, 1.6, 2.1, 2.2,
// 2.3, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 5.6, 5.8, 13.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7).
//
// The facade owns exactly one `QueueDriver` (default `MemoryDriver`), the
// handler registry, the middleware chain container, and the typed event
// emitter. It implements dispatch (envelope build + attempt-ceiling resolution
// + dedupe drop + immediate/delayed enqueue), handler registration, middleware
// registration, event subscription, `work` (returns a `Worker`), the
// dead-letter API surface (fully implemented in task 9.1), and graceful `close`.
//
// Scheduling (`schedule`) is wired in task 8.1 and the DLQ operations in task
// 9.1; those method bodies remain scaffolds here so this task stays focused on
// dispatch/register/lifecycle.
