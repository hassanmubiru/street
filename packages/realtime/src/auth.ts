// This module declares the `ChannelAuthorizer` used to gate Secured_Channels
// (Req 10) and the upgrade-authentication wiring (Req 3, 9): a factory that
// builds the `authFn` installed on the `StreetWebSocketServer` upgrade hook and
// the `WsHandler` that associates the resolved Member with the established
// `StreetSocket`.

 * credential is missing or invalid (Req 9.1, 9.2).

/**
 * The two pieces the facade installs on the WebSocket server to authenticate
 * realtime upgrades and associate identities:
 *
 *   - {@link RealtimeUpgradeAuth.authFn} — installed on the
 *     `StreetWebSocketServer` upgrade hook. It runs *after* the server's own
 *     origin gate (`isOriginAllowed`, Req 3.5/3.6 — we add no origin
 *     restriction of our own) and *before* the connection is accepted (Req 9.1).
 *     It resolves the Member via the configured {@link UpgradeAuthenticator};
 *     a missing/invalid credential (a `null` result or a thrown error) makes it
 *     return `false`, so the server rejects the upgrade with HTTP 401 and
 *     establishes no connection (Req 9.2). A resolved Member is stashed keyed by
 *     the upgrade request so the connection handler can associate it once the
 *     socket exists.
 *   - {@link RealtimeUpgradeAuth.handler} — the `WsHandler` passed to
 *     `StreetWebSocketServer.attach`. The server wraps the accepted socket as a
 *     `StreetSocket` before invoking this handler (Req 3.2); the handler then
 *     associates the stashed Member with that connection via the facade's
 *     `bind`, which also binds the hub-cleanup lifecycle so a close removes the
 *     connection from every room (Req 3.3, 9.3). If the identity cannot be
 *     associated, the connection is kept open without a Member association
 *     (Req 9.4).

 * (Req 3, 9). `authenticate` resolves a Member from the upgrade request (via the
 * Auth_Provider); `bind` associates the resolved Member with the established
 * connection (the facade's `bind`).
 *
 * A short-lived `WeakMap<IncomingMessage, Member>` carries the Member resolved
 * during `authFn` across to the `handler` that runs once the socket exists.
 * Keying on the request object (which the server passes to both the upgrade
 * hook and the connection handler) needs no shared mutable id and lets the
 * entry be garbage-collected if the upgrade is abandoned.
