// Verification Artifact subsystem — Platform Leadership exit-criteria aggregator
// (zero runtime deps).
//
// This module is the single place that computes the Platform Leadership
// classification. The decision is derived SOLELY from recorded Verification
// Artifacts (Requirement 12.4) — it is never authored, set, or edited by hand.
// A required capability with no recorded artifact is treated as not VERIFIED
// (Requirement 12.3), and the classification is GRANTED iff every required
// capability is VERIFIED (Requirement 12.1), otherwise WITHHELD together with
// each offending capability and its current status (Requirement 12.2). The
// emitted report records each required capability + status, the overall
// decision, an ISO-8601 timestamp, and the artifact paths it was computed from
// (Requirement 12.5). Uses only language built-ins — no runtime dependencies.
//
// _Requirements: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5_
