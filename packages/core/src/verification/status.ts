/**
 * Verification status engine for the Platform Leadership Gaps zero-trust
 * evidence standard.
 *
 * This module is part of `@streetjs/core` and therefore carries ZERO runtime
 * dependencies — it uses only pure TypeScript and Node core semantics. The
 * {@link classify} function is pure and deterministic: the same input always
 * yields the same {@link VerificationStatus}.
 *
 * Requirements covered:
 *  - 1.1 Exactly four Verification Statuses.
 *  - 1.2 Precedence order NOT_IMPLEMENTED → BLOCKED → VERIFIED → PARTIAL.
 *  - 1.3 VERIFIED requires all four evidence components and a zero exit code.
 *  - 1.4 PARTIAL when at least one but fewer than all evidence components.
 *  - 1.6 NOT_IMPLEMENTED when there is no source code.
 *  - 1.9 A non-zero command exit code can never be VERIFIED.
