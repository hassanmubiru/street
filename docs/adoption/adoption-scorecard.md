<div class="doc-header">
<span class="dh-label">Adoption</span>
<h1>Adoption Scorecard</h1>
<p>Measurable KPIs, refreshed quarterly. Values are <strong>measured signals</strong>, not estimates — where a value is not yet measurable it is marked <code>n/a (no signal)</code> rather than guessed. Honesty over optics.</p>
</div>

> **Baseline (2026-Q2):** the project is technically mature but early on
> adoption. Most community/ecosystem signals are at or near zero — that is the
> accurate starting point, not a failure.

<p class="scorecard-legend">In each table the <span class="sc-base">baseline</span> is the honest starting point and the highlighted <span class="sc-goal">Q+4</span> column is the one-year target.</p>

## How metrics are collected

- **GitHub:** contributors, PRs, Discussions via the GitHub API (no manual entry).
- **npm:** downloads via the npm registry API.
- **Registry:** plugin counts/levels from the StreetJS registry.
- **Enterprise/case studies:** counted only when a verifiable artifact exists
  (a merged case study, a recorded evaluation) — never self-asserted.

## Update cadence

Refreshed at the start of each quarter; the prior quarter's actuals are recorded
alongside the targets so trends are visible and targets stay honest.
