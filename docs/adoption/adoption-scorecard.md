# Adoption Scorecard

Measurable KPIs, updated quarterly. Values are **measured signals**, not
estimates — where a value is not yet measurable it is marked `n/a (no signal)`
rather than guessed. Honesty over optics.

> **Baseline (2026-Q2):** the project is technically mature but early on
> adoption. Most community/ecosystem signals are at or near zero — that is the
> accurate starting point, not a failure.

## How metrics are collected

- **GitHub:** contributors, PRs, Discussions via the GitHub API (no manual entry).
- **npm:** downloads via the npm registry API.
- **Registry:** plugin counts/levels from the StreetJS registry.
- **Enterprise/case studies:** counted only when a verifiable artifact exists
  (a merged case study, a recorded evaluation) — never self-asserted.

## Update cadence

Refreshed at the start of each quarter; the prior quarter's actuals are recorded
alongside the targets so trends are visible and targets stay honest.
