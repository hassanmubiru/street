# What Can Be Built With Street Framework

Street is a **general-purpose TypeScript backend framework** comparable in scope to Express, Fastify, NestJS, Spring Boot, ASP.NET Core, and Laravel — with a TypeScript-first, memory-conscious, and security-focused design that makes it suitable for production workloads across every industry vertical.

This page shows what you can build, how Street's architecture maps to each domain, and which framework features carry the most weight in each context.

## 1. Web Applications

### Description

Traditional and modern web applications — from server-rendered dashboards to single-page app backends — need a reliable HTTP layer, session management, file handling, and database access. Street handles all of these natively without reaching for third-party middleware.

### Typical architecture

```
Browser / SPA
    │
    ▼
Street HTTP Server
    ├── securityHeaders + corsMiddleware + csrfMiddleware
    ├── SessionManager (AES-256-GCM cookies)
    ├── RateLimiter (per-IP sliding window)
    ├── Router → Controllers → Services
    ├── MultipartParser (file uploads → disk)
    ├── PgPool → PostgreSQL
    └── SseConnection (live notifications)
```

### Street features used

- `streetApp` + `Router` — HTTP server and routing
- `SessionManager` — encrypted cookie sessions
- `csrfMiddleware` — CSRF protection for form submissions
- `MultipartParser` — streaming file uploads
- `SseConnection` — live feed updates without WebSocket overhead
- `PgPool` + `StreetPostgresRepository` — data persistence
- `securityHeaders` — CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options

### Benefits

- Zero-dependency session encryption — no `express-session`, no Redis required for basic use
- Streaming file uploads never spike heap regardless of file size
- CSRF protection is built in, not bolted on
- OpenAPI spec auto-generated for any API surface exposed to the frontend

Street is purpose-built for API development. Its decorator-based routing, built-in validation, automatic OpenAPI generation, and parameterized query layer eliminate the boilerplate that dominates API projects in other frameworks.

### Typical architecture

```
API Consumers (web, mobile, third-party)
    │
    ▼
Street HTTP Server
    ├── corsMiddleware (origin allowlist)
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT)
    ├── RateLimiter
    ├── @Controller → @Get / @Post / @Put / @Delete
    ├── @Validate (request schema enforcement)
    ├── Services → PgPool
    └── /openapi.json (auto-generated spec)
```

### Street features used

- `@Controller`, `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Delete`, `@Patch` — declarative routing
- `@Validate` — request body/query/params validation without Zod or Joi
- `@ApiOperation` — OpenAPI 3.1 spec generation
- `JwtService` + `authMiddleware` — Bearer token auth
- `PgPool` + `StreetPostgresRepository` — typed data access
- `corsMiddleware` — cross-origin access control

### Benefits

- OpenAPI spec is always in sync with the code — no separate schema maintenance
- `@Validate` catches malformed requests before they reach business logic
- Parameterized queries throughout — SQL injection is structurally prevented
- No framework overhead from unused features (no ORM, no template engine)

### Example project ideas

| Project | Key Street features |
|---|---|
| Public REST API (SaaS product) | OpenAPI, JWT, rate limiting, CORS, PostgreSQL |

---

## 4. Microservices

### Description

Microservice architectures decompose a system into small, independently deployable services. Street's minimal footprint, fast startup, DI container, and clustering support make each service lean and self-contained. Its native PostgreSQL driver means no shared ORM layer between services.

### Typical architecture

```
API Gateway / Load Balancer
    │
    ├── Street Service A (users)      ─── PostgreSQL DB A
    ├── Street Service B (orders)     ─── PostgreSQL DB B
    ├── Street Service C (inventory)  ─── PostgreSQL DB C
    └── Street Service D (notifications) ─── WebhookDispatcher
              │
              └── Inter-service: HTTP webhooks (HMAC-signed)
```

### Street features used

- `streetApp` — lightweight per-service HTTP server
- `ClusterCoordinator` — multi-core utilization per service
- `WebhookDispatcher` — HMAC-signed inter-service event delivery
- `PgPool` — isolated database per service (database-per-service pattern)
- `TelemetryTracker` — per-service health and latency metrics
- `StreetMigrationRunner` — independent schema migrations per service
- `JwtService` — service-to-service JWT authentication

### Benefits

- Sub-100ms cold start — no framework initialization overhead
- Each service owns its schema and migrates independently
- HMAC-signed webhooks provide tamper-proof inter-service messaging
- Telemetry endpoint (`/health`, `/metrics`) ready out of the box for orchestrators

### Example project ideas

| Project | Key Street features |
|---|---|
| User service | JWT, PostgreSQL, migrations, health endpoint |
| Order processing service | PostgreSQL transactions, webhooks (payment triggers), clustering |
| Notification service | WebhookDispatcher (outbound), SSE (inbound push to clients) |
| File storage service | MultipartParser, streaming to object storage, PostgreSQL metadata |
| Auth service | JWT signing/verification, scrypt password hashing, vault, rate limiting |

```typescript
// Minimal microservice — ~30 lines
import { streetApp, PgPool, TelemetryTracker,
         securityHeaders, RateLimiter } from '@streetjs/core';

const pool = new PgPool({ host: process.env['PG_HOST']!, /* ... */ });
const telemetry = new TelemetryTracker();
const limiter = new RateLimiter({ windowMs: 60_000, maxRequests: 500 });

const app = streetApp({ port: 3000 });
app.use(securityHeaders);
app.use(limiter.middleware());
app.registerController(OrderController);

await pool.initialize();
await app.listen();
```

## 5. Real-Time Systems

### Description

Real-time systems — live dashboards, collaborative tools, notification hubs, live sports scores, trading tickers — require persistent connections, low-latency message delivery, and robust connection lifecycle management. Street provides both WebSocket and SSE transports with built-in heartbeat and bounded connection pools.

### Typical architecture

```
Clients
    │  WebSocket (bidirectional)   │  SSE (server-push)
    ▼                              ▼

    ├── authFn (JWT on upgrade)    ├── heartbeat timer
    ├── heartbeat (ping/pong)      ├── CR/LF-safe serialization
    ├── maxConnections cap         └── cleanup on disconnect
    ├── broadcast()
    └── StreetSocket (typed events)
              │
              ▼
         PgPool → PostgreSQL (event source)
         TelemetryTracker (connection metrics)
```

### Street features used

## 13. Enterprise Software

### Description

Enterprise software — ERP systems, CRM platforms, HR management, supply chain tools — serves large internal user bases with complex permission hierarchies, integration requirements, and strict audit trails. Street's DI container, RBAC, and ACID transactions map directly to enterprise patterns.

### Typical architecture

```
Enterprise Users (web, desktop clients)
    │  (SSO JWT or SAML-to-JWT bridge)
    ▼
Street HTTP Server
    ├── securityHeaders
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT from SSO)
    ├── requireRoles (employee / manager / director / admin)
    ├── csrfMiddleware
    ├── Router → Controllers → Services (DI container)
    │       └── PgPool.transaction() (ACID)
    ├── StreetMigrationRunner (schema versioning)
    ├── Vault (sensitive config at rest)
    ├── TelemetryTracker (SLA monitoring)
    └── WebhookDispatcher (ERP integration events)
```

### Street features used

- `Container` (DI) — clean separation of controllers, services, repositories
- `requireRoles` — hierarchical RBAC (employee → manager → director → admin)
- `PgPool.transaction()` — atomic multi-table writes (order + inventory + ledger)
- `StreetMigrationRunner` — zero-downtime schema evolution with rollback support
- `Vault` — encrypted database credentials and integration API keys
- `WebhookDispatcher` — push events to ERP, CRM, and HR systems
- `TelemetryTracker` — P50/P99 latency for SLA dashboards
- `ClusterCoordinator` — high availability for business-critical services

### Benefits

## 14. AI Infrastructure

### Description

AI infrastructure backends — model serving APIs, training job orchestrators, vector database proxies, RAG pipelines, AI agent frameworks — need high-throughput request handling, streaming response delivery, and reliable job queuing. Street's SSE streaming and PostgreSQL integration make it a strong foundation for AI-adjacent services.

### Typical architecture

```
AI Clients (web apps, agents, notebooks)
    │
    ▼
Street HTTP Server
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT or API key)
    ├── RateLimiter (per-user token budget)
    ├── Router → InferenceController
    │       ├── SseConnection (streaming token output)
    │       ├── PgPool (conversation history, embeddings)
    │       └── WebhookDispatcher (async job completion)
    ├── MultipartParser (document / image upload for RAG)
    └── LruCache (embedding cache, prompt cache)
```

### Street features used

- `SseConnection` — stream LLM token output to clients (ChatGPT-style streaming)
- `RateLimiter` — per-user token rate limiting (requests per minute / tokens per day)
- `MultipartParser` — document and image uploads for RAG pipelines
- `LruCache` — cache embeddings and prompt completions with TTL
- `PgPool` — store conversation history, embeddings (pgvector), job queue
- `WebhookDispatcher` — notify clients when async inference jobs complete
- `JwtService` — API key authentication (sign a JWT per API key)
- `ClusterCoordinator` — multi-core inference request handling

### Benefits

- SSE streaming delivers token-by-token output with zero additional dependencies
- Rate limiting enforces per-user token budgets without a separate quota service
- LRU cache with TTL reduces redundant embedding computations
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension stores and queries embeddings natively

### Example project ideas

| Project | Key Street features |
|---|---|
| LLM inference API | SSE (token streaming), JWT, rate limiting, PostgreSQL (history) |
| RAG pipeline backend | Multipart (doc upload), PostgreSQL (pgvector), LRU cache, JWT |
| AI agent orchestrator | WebSocket (agent events), PostgreSQL (state), webhooks, clustering |
| Embedding service | REST API, LRU cache, PostgreSQL, rate limiting, OpenAPI |
| AI-powered search backend | PostgreSQL (pgvector), JWT, rate limiting, SSE (streaming results) |
| Model fine-tuning job API | Multipart (dataset upload), PostgreSQL (job queue), webhooks |

```typescript
// Streaming LLM response via SSE
@Get('/chat/stream')
async streamChat(ctx: StreetContext): Promise<void> {
  const sse = createSse(ctx.res);
  const prompt = ctx.query['q'] ?? '';

  // Stream tokens from your inference engine
  for await (const token of inferenceEngine.stream(prompt)) {
    sse.send({ event: 'token', data: { text: token } });
  }

  sse.send({ event: 'done', data: { finish_reason: 'stop' } });
  sse.close();
}
```

## 15. Cybersecurity Platforms

### Description

Cybersecurity platforms — SIEM systems, vulnerability scanners, threat intelligence feeds, SOC dashboards, penetration testing tools, and security automation platforms — need high-throughput event ingestion, real-time alerting, tamper-proof audit logs, and strict access control. Street's security-first design makes it uniquely suited here.

### Typical architecture

```
Security Agents / Sensors / SIEM Integrations
    │  (HTTPS + HMAC-signed payloads)
    ▼
Street HTTP Server (event ingestion)
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT, short expiry)
    ├── requireRoles (analyst / engineer / admin)
    ├── RateLimiter (per-agent, per-source)
    ├── Router → EventController
    │       └── PgPool (event store, IOC database)
    ├── StreetWebSocketServer (SOC live feed)
    ├── SseConnection (alert stream to dashboard)
    ├── WebhookDispatcher (SIEM / ticketing integrations)
    └── Vault (API keys for threat intel feeds)
```

### Street features used

- `JwtService` — short-lived analyst tokens (15 min) with role claims
- `requireRoles` — analyst / engineer / admin separation of duties
- `RateLimiter` — per-agent ingestion rate limiting
- `StreetWebSocketServer` — real-time SOC alert feed
- `SseConnection` — live threat dashboard without polling
- `WebhookDispatcher` — push alerts to PagerDuty, Jira, Slack (HMAC-signed)
- `Vault` — encrypted threat intelligence API keys at rest
- `PgPool.transaction()` — atomic event correlation writes
- `constantTimeEqual` — timing-safe API key comparison
- `securityHeaders` — hardened headers for SOC web interface

### Benefits

- `constantTimeEqual` prevents timing oracle attacks on API key validation
- Vault mode keeps threat intel API keys encrypted — a compromised database reveals nothing
- HMAC-signed webhooks give SIEM integrations tamper-proof event delivery
- Rate limiting per agent prevents a compromised sensor from flooding the event store
- Short-lived JWT tokens limit the blast radius of stolen analyst credentials

### Example project ideas

| Project | Key Street features |
|---|---|
| SIEM event ingestion API | Rate limiting, PostgreSQL, JWT, webhooks, clustering |
| SOC real-time dashboard | WebSocket, SSE, JWT, RBAC, PostgreSQL |
| Threat intelligence platform | Vault (API keys), PostgreSQL, JWT, LRU cache, OpenAPI |
| Vulnerability scanner backend | REST API, PostgreSQL, JWT, RBAC, webhooks (ticket creation) |
| Security automation platform | Webhooks, PostgreSQL, JWT, rate limiting, clustering |

## 16. Government Systems

### Description

Government systems — citizen portals, permit management, tax filing platforms, public records APIs, emergency services backends — operate under strict compliance frameworks (FedRAMP, FISMA, GDPR, WCAG) and require the highest levels of security, auditability, and availability.

### Typical architecture

```
Citizens / Government Staff
    │  (HTTPS + MFA-backed JWT)
    ▼
Street HTTP Server
    ├── securityHeaders (HSTS preload, CSP, COOP, CORP)
    ├── authMiddleware (JWT from identity provider)
    ├── requireRoles (citizen / clerk / supervisor / admin)
    ├── csrfMiddleware
    ├── xssMiddleware
    ├── RateLimiter (per-citizen, per-IP)
    ├── Router → Controllers → Services (DI)
    │       └── PgPool.transaction() (ACID)
    ├── StreetMigrationRunner (auditable schema changes)
    ├── Vault (PII encryption at rest)
    ├── MultipartParser (document submissions)
    ├── TelemetryTracker (uptime SLA monitoring)
    └── ClusterCoordinator (high availability)
```

### Street features used

- `Vault` — AES-256-GCM encryption of citizen PII (SSN, address, tax ID)
- `requireRoles` — strict separation between citizen self-service and staff access
- `csrfMiddleware` — CSRF protection for all government form submissions
- `xssMiddleware` — sanitize all citizen-submitted input
- `securityHeaders` — HSTS preload, CSP, COOP, CORP for FedRAMP compliance
- `StreetMigrationRunner` — versioned, auditable schema changes with rollback
- `PgPool.transaction()` — atomic permit approvals and record updates
- `MultipartParser` — citizen document uploads (ID, proof of address)
- `TelemetryTracker` — uptime and latency for SLA reporting
- `ClusterCoordinator` — zero-downtime rolling restarts

### Benefits

- Vault mode satisfies data-at-rest encryption requirements (FedRAMP, FISMA)
- CSRF + XSS middleware provides defense-in-depth for citizen-facing forms
- HSTS preload and CSP headers satisfy WCAG and security compliance checklists
- Migration runner with rollback enables safe schema changes without downtime
- Telemetry endpoint provides uptime data for SLA reporting without a separate APM

### Example project ideas

| Project | Key Street features |
|---|---|
| Citizen portal backend | Vault (PII), RBAC, CSRF, XSS, HSTS, PostgreSQL, multipart |
| Permit management system | ACID transactions, RBAC, migrations, PostgreSQL, file uploads |
| Tax filing platform | Vault (PII), CSRF, RBAC, PostgreSQL, rate limiting, clustering |

## Framework comparison

Street is positioned as a **general-purpose production backend framework** comparable to the following:

| Framework | Language | Street advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Express** | JavaScript | TypeScript-first, memory bounds, built-in security, native PostgreSQL |
| **Fastify** | JavaScript/TypeScript | Built-in auth, sessions, WebSocket, PostgreSQL — no plugin ecosystem needed |
| **NestJS** | TypeScript | Lighter DI, no class-validator/class-transformer dependency, native wire protocol |
| **Spring Boot** | Java | Same production-grade features, Node.js ecosystem, faster cold start |
| **ASP.NET Core** | C# | TypeScript-first, no runtime license, same security depth |
| **Laravel** | PHP | Statically typed, memory-safe, no ORM overhead, native async |
| **Django** | Python | Async-native, TypeScript types, no GIL, horizontal scaling via clustering |
| **Gin / Echo** | Go | Richer built-in feature set (auth, sessions, WebSocket, migrations) |

Street does not require you to assemble a security stack from separate packages. JWT, sessions, rate limiting, XSS sanitization, CSRF protection, security headers, CORS, vault encryption, and HMAC-signed webhooks are all included and integrated.

## Choosing Street for your project

Use Street when you need:

- **TypeScript throughout** — strict mode, `NodeNext` ESM, full type inference
- **Security by default** — every security primitive built in, not bolted on
- **Memory predictability** — explicit bounds on every collection, buffer, and connection
- **No dependency sprawl** — two runtime dependencies (`reflect-metadata`, `ws`)
- **Native PostgreSQL** — wire protocol v3, SCRAM-SHA-256, no `pg` package
- **Production-ready from day one** — clustering, telemetry, health endpoints, migrations

```bash
npm install -g @streetjs/cli
street create my-project
cd my-project && npm install && street dev
```

{: .note }
Street is MIT-licensed and runs on Node.js 20+. See the [Getting Started](/getting-started/installation/) guide to scaffold your first project in under 60 seconds.
