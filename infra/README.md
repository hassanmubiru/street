# StreetJS Infrastructure

Production deployment + monitoring assets for StreetJS, consolidated under `infra/`:

```
infra/
├── docker/        # (Dockerfile + docker-compose*.yml remain at the repo root —
│                  #  they have build-context/volume paths relative to root)
├── kubernetes/    # k8s manifests (HPA example, probes)
├── helm/street/   # Helm chart
├── examples/      # aws-ecs, cloud-run, cloudflare, vercel
└── monitoring/    # prometheus rules + grafana dashboards
```

> **Note:** the root `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose*.yml` are intentionally kept
> at the repo root — their `build: context: .` and `./packages/...` volume paths
> resolve relative to the root. Moving them requires `--project-directory .` +
> `dockerfile:` overrides and Docker-tested verification (tracked in
> `security/SECURITY-HARDENING-SPRINT.md` §P1-4).

Every target boots the same container/app, which exposes:

- `GET /health/live` — liveness (no dependencies)
- `GET /health/ready` — readiness (includes a Postgres reachability check)

**Security-first default:** in `NODE_ENV=production` the app refuses to boot
without `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` set (no accidental wildcard CORS). Always provide
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `JWT_SECRET` (≥32 chars), `SESSION_KEY` (64 hex), `KEK`, and
`PG_*` via your platform's secret store.

## Targets

| Target | Artifact | Verification level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker | `Dockerfile` (repo root) | ✅ image builds; container boots (prod, clustered); `/health/live` + `/health/ready` → 200 |
| Kubernetes / Helm | `infra/helm/street/`, `infra/kubernetes/` | manifests complete (startup/liveness/readiness probes on verified paths, Service, HPA) |
| AWS Lambda | `@streetjs/edge` lambda adapter | ✅ adapter unit-tested |
| Azure Functions | `@streetjs/edge` azure adapter | ✅ adapter unit-tested |
| Google Cloud Run | `infra/examples/cloud-run/service.yaml` | manifest authored + YAML-validated |
| Cloudflare Workers | `infra/examples/cloudflare/wrangler.toml` + `@streetjs/edge` worker adapter | config authored; adapter unit-tested |
| AWS ECS (Fargate) | `infra/examples/aws-ecs/task-definition.json` | manifest authored + JSON-validated |
| Vercel | `infra/examples/vercel/vercel.json` + `@streetjs/edge` | config authored |

## Smoke test (any target)

```bash
BASE_URL=https://your-instance bash scripts/deploy/smoke-test.sh
```

Verifies `/health/live` and `/health/ready` return 200; exits non-zero
otherwise, so it can gate a deploy or trigger a rollback.

## Rollback

- **Kubernetes:** `kubectl rollout undo deployment/streetjs`
- **Helm:** `helm rollback streetjs <REVISION>`
- **Cloud Run:** `gcloud run services update-traffic streetjs --to-revisions=PREV=100`
- **ECS:** update the service to the previous task-definition revision
- **Lambda/Workers/Vercel:** redeploy/alias the previous version

## Monitoring

The app emits Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry spans (see
`docs/` observability guides and `observability/`). Wire `/health/ready` to your
platform's readiness gate and scrape the metrics endpoint; Grafana dashboards
and Prometheus rules ship under `observability/`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/deploy-verify.yml` validates deployment artifacts in CI.
